# Video Strategy 2: Outcome-First Narrative

## Core Angle
**"Your Shortlist Is Already Waiting"**

Start with the destination. Show the result first. Then explain how you got there.

---

## Strategic Foundation

### Psychological Framework
- **Priming**: Present the outcome first to create desire
- **Curiosity Gap**: Viewer wants to know "how?"
- **Loss Aversion**: Once they see the result, not having it feels like a loss

### Target Viewer State
Someone who knows they need to improve hiring but hasn't seen what "better" actually looks like. They need proof before belief.

## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Result (0:00–0:06)

**What Happens:**
Clean, bright frame. A hiring manager's screen. A shortlist of 5 candidates, ranked 94, 91, 88, 86, 82. Each with a clear match score and key qualifications visible.

**Voiceover:**
> "This is your shortlist. Five candidates. Already ranked. Already matched to your exact requirements."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Hero shot of Niyo's candidate ranking interface
- Subtle highlight on scores
- Warm, confident lighting

**Why This Works:**
Opens with the payoff. No preamble. The viewer immediately sees what success looks like. The specificity (five candidates, real scores) creates tangibility.

---

### Scene 2: The Context (0:06–0:12)

**What Happens:**
Pull back. We see context: 312 applications came in for this role. The 5 shown are the top-ranked from that pool.

**Voiceover:**
> "Three hundred twelve applications came in for this role. These five rose to the top — automatically."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Subtle zoom out to show application count
- Visual indication of filtering/ranking process
- "Automatically" emphasized with visual cue

**Why This Works:**
Establishes scale. The contrast (312 → 5) is the magic. The word "automatically" plants the key differentiator.

---

### Scene 3: The Time (0:12–0:18)

**What Happens:**
A clock graphic or timestamp. Shows: "Time from job posted to shortlist: 2 hours, 14 minutes."

**Voiceover:**
> "Two hours. Not two weeks. And every candidate scored against the same criteria, the same way, every time."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Clean time display
- Subtle consistency visualization (repeating pattern)
- "Every time" lands with visual punctuation

**Why This Works:**
Quantifies the speed advantage. The consistency message addresses the hidden AI skepticism: "but can I trust it?"

---

### Scene 4: The "How" Tease (0:18–0:24)

**What Happens:**
Transition. Visual curiosity prompt. Interface elements begin to animate.

**Voiceover:**
> "How? Niyo reads every CV. Extracts qualifications. Maps them against your job requirements. And ranks by best match."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Abstract CV-to-data visualization
- Matching animation (requirements ↔ qualifications)
- Ranking emerging from the match

**Why This Works:**
Brief explanation satisfies "but how does it work?" without getting technical. The visual does the heavy lifting.

---

### Scene 5: The Journey (0:24–0:38)

**What Happens:**
Quick walk-through of the full workflow: Job posting → Career page live → Applications flowing in → AI parsing and scoring → Pipeline view → Interview scheduling.

**Voiceover:**
> "Post a job in seconds. Get a branded career page instantly. Watch applications flow in. Let AI do the screening. Move top candidates through your pipeline. Schedule interviews without the back-and-forth."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- 6 micro-segments, ~2.3 seconds each
- Smooth transitions between phases
- Each phase shown as complete, not work-in-progress
- Progress indicators filling, not spinning

**Why This Works:**
Shows the complete system. Addresses "is this just screening or is it end-to-end?" The pace feels efficient, not rushed.

---

### Scene 6: The Trust Layer (0:38–0:45)

**What Happens:**
Focus on explainability. A candidate's match breakdown appears: skills matched, experience aligned, requirements met. Clear, readable.

**Voiceover:**
> "And you always know why. Every score is explainable. Every decision transparent. No black box. No guessing."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Candidate detail view with match reasons
- Visual hierarchy showing score composition
- Trust language reinforced visually

**Why This Works:**
Addresses the #1 AI objection: "I don't trust something I can't see inside." Niyo's explainability is a key differentiator — this is where it shines.

---

### Scene 7: The Contrast (0:45–0:52)

**What Happens:**
Subtle comparison. Not attacking competitors, but showing the old way fading out while the new way stays.

**Voiceover:**
> "Other tools make you choose: either manage process or use AI. Niyo does both. One system. Complete hiring journey."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Fragmented tools dissolving
- Niyo interface remaining, unified
- "One system" visual emphasis

**Why This Works:**
Positions against both ATS (process) and AI-only tools (intelligence) without naming them. Defines Niyo's category.

---

### Scene 8: The Invitation (0:52–1:00)

**What Happens:**
Final frame. Niyo logo. Strong CTA.

**Voiceover:**
> "See your next shortlist appear. Try Niyo free — your first ranked candidates in minutes, not weeks."

**On Screen:**
- Logo + unified tagline: "Hire faster. Hire better."
- CTA: "Start Free — No Credit Card"
- Micro-trust: "Cancel anytime • Your data stays yours"

**Why This Works:**
The CTA promises an experience, not a commitment. "Minutes, not weeks" echoes the opening time contrast. Low friction close.

## Why This Strategy Wins

1. **Leads with proof**: The shortlist is the product, show it first
2. **Creates desire before explanation**: Viewer wants the result, then learns how
3. **Addresses objections in flow**: Trust, explainability, completeness
4. **Shows the full system**: Not a feature, a workflow
5. **Low-friction close**: Experience-first CTA

This video assumes the viewer is skeptical but persuadable. It earns belief through demonstration, not claims.
