# Pricing Page Analysis

Currently has solid functional pricing page, but conversion-wise it has serious gaps. Right now it reads like internal documentation, not a decision page.

## 1. Core Gaps (High-Impact Issues)

### Gap 1: Feature Overload Before Value

You lead with:

> “Simple, transparent pricing”

Then immediately dump a massive feature table.

**Problem:**

Buyers haven’t decided why they should care yet. You’re asking them to compare before you’ve sold the outcome.

👉 This is the #1 conversion killer.

---

### Gap 2: No Clear “Best Plan” Narrative

You have Growth, Professional, Enterprise — but nothing guides the choice.

**Problem:**

When users must decide alone, they default to:

- Free plan
- Or leave

---

### Gap 3: Pricing Is Detached from Pain

$39 / $99 appear with no cost anchor.

**Problem:**

Without anchoring, users subconsciously compare you to:

- ChatGPT ($20)
- Cheap AI tools
- Not to bad hires, lost time, or recruiter salary.

---

### Gap 4: Feature Table Is Too Honest (Yes, That’s Bad)

You expose:

- “Coming soon”
- Empty cells
- Repetition
- Duplicate sections (“Detailed Feature Comparison” appears twice)

**Problem:**

This triggers doubt:

> “Is this finished?”
> “Am I buying a roadmap?”

---

### Gap 5: Add-ons Feel Like Nickel-and-Diming

Add-ons are listed like a telecom bill.

**Problem:**

Instead of feeling flexible, it feels like:

> “I’ll get charged unexpectedly later.”

---

## 2. How to Make This Highly Convertible (Concrete Fixes)

### FIX 1: Add a Strong Outcome-Led Pricing Hero (Mandatory)

Replace the top section with:

> **Pricing that costs less than one bad hire**
>
> Pay for hiring clarity, speed, and consistency — not AI buzzwords.

**Subtext:**

Most teams save 20–40 hours per role by automating screening and interviews.

**Impact:**

Immediately reframes price as ROI, not expense.

---

### FIX 2: Introduce a “Who This Is For” Selector (Critical)

Before the plans, add 3 short personas:

- Hiring occasionally → Growth
- Hiring every month → Professional (Most Popular)
- Hiring at scale → Enterprise

**Impact:**

Removes decision anxiety. Users self-select faster.

---

### FIX 3: Rewrite Plan Cards Around Outcomes (Not Limits)

**Growth (Rewrite Example)**

**Before:**

> “5 active job postings, 500 candidates/month”

**After:**

**Growth — Stop Manual Screening**
For small teams hiring without a dedicated recruiter

**Key bullets:**

- Shortlist qualified candidates automatically
- Replace CV screening with AI ranking
- Interview without scheduling back-and-forth

Then show limits after value.

**Impact:**

Users buy relief, not numbers.

---

### FIX 4: Add “Most Popular” + Visual Emphasis to Professional

Professional should be visually dominant and labeled:

> ⭐ Most teams choose this

Add a short justification:

> “Best balance of speed, automation, and scale.”

**Impact:**

Classic decoy effect → increases mid-tier conversions.

---

### FIX 5: Kill Redundant & Empty Feature Rows

What to remove or hide:

- Empty cells
- “Coming soon”
- Duplicate “Detailed Feature Comparison”
- Repeated feature names

Replace with:

- A collapsed comparison table
- Expand-on-click for power users

**Impact:**

Cleaner UI → higher trust → fewer drop-offs.

---

### FIX 6: Reframe Add-Ons as “Safety Valves”

Rename section:

> **Scale Without Switching Plans**

Rewrite add-ons like:

- Extra AI Interviews – “When hiring spikes unexpectedly”
- Extra Job Postings – “For temporary hiring surges”

Add a line:

> Only pay extra when your hiring volume temporarily increases.

**Impact:**

Feels flexible, not predatory.

---

### FIX 7: Strong Cost Anchor (Non-Negotiable)

Add this between plans and FAQs:

> One bad hire costs 6–9 months of salary.
> Niyo costs less than that per year.

**Impact:**

This single line often outperforms discounts.

---

### FIX 8: Rewrite the Bottom CTA (Stronger Close)

**Before:**

> “Still not sure? Start free today.”

**After:**

> See how fast your next shortlist appears.
> Upload real CVs. No credit card. No sales call.

Add micro-trust:

- Cancel anytime
- Your data is never used to train models
- Explainable AI scoring

**Impact:**

Shifts CTA from “commitment” to “experiment”.

Niyo's pricing communication is weak.

Right now, this page answers:

> “What does Niyo have?”

A high-converting pricing page answers:

> “Why would I be irresponsible not to use this?”
