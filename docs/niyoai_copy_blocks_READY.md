## SECTION 2: THE VILLAIN (Pain Amplification)

```
HEADLINE:
Six Weeks. Three Hundred CVs. Still No Hire.

BODY:
You're not slow. The system is broken.

While you're manually reading resumes:
→ Your best candidates accept other offers
→ Recruiters burn out on unqualified applications
→ Hiring managers lose faith in the process
→ Your competitor's new hire is already shipping code

Every week without the right hire costs you momentum, morale, and market share.

TRANSITION LINE:
There's a better way. And it takes 47 seconds.
```

---

## SECTION 3: THE REVELATION (Solution Introduction)

```
HEADLINE:
What If Your Perfect Shortlist Appeared in 47 Seconds?

SUBHEADLINE:
That's Niyo.

BODY:
Not a tool. Not an add-on. A complete hiring system that does in minutes what used to take weeks:

→ AI reads every CV (you never open a PDF again)
→ Ranks candidates by job fit (explainable scores, not black-box magic)
→ Surfaces the best 3-5 people (ready to interview, not "maybe qualified")
→ Runs structured interviews (without calendar tetris)
→ Gives your team clarity (audit trails, not gut feelings)

From job post to shortlist — fully automated. Zero chaos.

STAT CALLOUTS (4-column visual):
47 sec                94%                   3.8x                  $47K
avg time to           screening             faster                saved per
shortlist             accuracy              hiring                role
```

---

## SECTION 4: HOW IT WORKS (Proof of Simplicity)

```
HEADLINE:
From Chaos to Hire — In 4 Steps You'll Actually Use

STEP 1: Post Your Job (3 seconds)
Type "Senior Product Manager" → AI writes the full job description → Career page goes live at company.niyo.careers

No designers. No developers. Just done.

---

STEP 2: Candidates Apply (Automatic)
Custom forms collect exactly what you need. Every CV auto-parsed into structured profiles. Zero manual data entry.

67 candidates in 2 hours. All organized. All ready.

---

STEP 3: AI Creates Your Shortlist (47 seconds)
67 candidates → AI scores & ranks → Top 5 appear with explainable breakdowns:

✓ 7 years product management experience
✓ B2B SaaS background
✓ Led teams of 5-12 people
✓ Startup to scale-up experience

No guesswork. No bias. Just signal.

---

STEP 4: Interview & Hire (Without the Chaos)
AI video interviews run asynchronously. Candidates answer on their time. Your team reviews on yours.

No calendar tetris. No "quick sync" meetings. No scheduling hell. Just decisions.

CLOSING LINE:
From job post to shortlist: 47 seconds. From shortlist to hire: your timeline.
```

---

## SECTION 5: WHY NOT CHATGPT? (Critical Objection Handler)

```
HEADLINE:
"Can't I Just Use ChatGPT for This?"

SUBHEADLINE:
You could. Here's what happens:

BODY:
→ You copy-paste 67 CVs one by one (that's 40+ hours)
→ You rewrite prompts until the output makes sense
→ You manually track decisions in spreadsheets
→ Your teammate uses different prompts → inconsistent results
→ You rebuild the entire process next month for a new role

ChatGPT helps you think. Niyo helps you hire.

COMPARISON TABLE HEADLINE:
What Hiring Actually Requires vs. What Tools Actually Deliver

[Table appears here - see main blueprint]

CLOSING STATEMENT:
General AI is brilliant for ad-hoc questions. Hiring requires systems, consistency, and accountability.

ChatGPT is a tool. Niyo is a hiring system.
Tools are cheap. Bad hires are expensive.

## SECTION 6: SOCIAL PROOF BOMB (Credibility at Peak)

```
HEADLINE:
Teams Using Niyo Aren't Just Hiring Faster.
They're Hiring Better — With Proof.

TESTIMONIAL 1:
"We filled three engineering roles in two weeks. Before Niyo, that would've taken two months and burned out our entire team."

— Marcus Rodriguez, Founder @ TechFlow (Series A, 47 employees)
Saved: 180 hours of screening time

---

TESTIMONIAL 2:
"Cut time-to-hire by 68%. Our recruiters went from drowning in CVs to focusing on culture fit and final interviews."

— Sarah Chen, Head of Talent @ GrowthLabs (250+ employees)
12 roles filled, avg 4.2 days to shortlist

---

TESTIMONIAL 3:
"First hire using Niyo shipped code in week one. That's never happened in my 15 years of hiring."

— James Park, VP Engineering @ DataCorp (Series B)
5 engineering hires, 94% still with company after 12 months

---

STAT CALLOUT (Large, centered):
94% screening accuracy  •  3.8x faster hiring  •  $47K saved per role

FINE PRINT:
Based on 50,000+ candidates screened across 500+ companies
```

---

## SECTION 7: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (ATS vs AI vs Niyo)

```
HEADLINE:
Not Just an ATS. Not Just an AI Tool.
A Hiring System Built for Decisions.

SUBHEADLINE:
The market has three types of solutions. Only one makes hiring predictable.

[Comparison table appears here - see main blueprint]

NARRATIVE BLOCK:
ATS platforms organize your chaos. They don't make decisions for you.

AI-only tools give you fragments — a parser here, a scorer there — then leave you to stitch it all together.

Niyo gives you clarity, consistency, and confidence from job post to hire.

CLOSING LINE:
You're not buying features. You're buying repeatable outcomes.
```

---

## SECTION 8: RISK REVERSAL (Remove All Friction)

```
HEADLINE:
"Look, You're Skeptical. Good."

```

---

## SECTION 9: OPPORTUNITY COST (Urgency Through Loss)

```
HEADLINE:
Every Day You're Manually Screening...
Your Competitor's New Hire Is Shipping Code.

BODY:
WEEK 1: You're still reading CV #47.
        They're onboarding their new hire.

WEEK 2: You're scheduling "quick syncs."
        Their hire is in daily standups.

WEEK 3: You're narrowing to your final 5.
        Their hire just shipped their first feature.

CLOSING QUESTION:
The question isn't "Should I try Niyo?"

## HELP CENTER / FAQ CONNECTOR COPY

```
COMMON QUESTION:
"How is this different from using ChatGPT for screening?"

ANSWER:
ChatGPT is brilliant for one-off questions, but hiring requires:
- Bulk CV processing (not copy-paste)
- Consistent scoring (not prompt-dependent)
- Audit trails (not chat history)
- Team collaboration (not solo work)
- Repeatable workflows (not starting over each time)

Niyo is a complete hiring system, not a general AI tool.
