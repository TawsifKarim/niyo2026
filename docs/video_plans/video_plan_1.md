# Video Strategy 1: Pain-First Narrative

## Core Angle
**"The Crushing Weight of Manual Screening"**

Open with visceral pain. Make the viewer feel the frustration they've normalized. Then reveal the exit.

---

## Strategic Foundation

### Psychological Framework
- **Negativity Bias**: Humans process pain faster than pleasure
- **Recognition**: Viewer sees their own struggle reflected
- **Relief**: The solution feels earned, not sold

### Target Viewer State
Someone who has personally experienced CV screening exhaustion but hasn't yet connected that pain to a solvable system problem.

## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Pile (0:00–0:08)

**What Happens:**
Dark, moody visual. A recruiter's desk. Coffee gone cold. Screen showing 847 unread applications. Mouse cursor hovering. Nothing moves.

**Voiceover:**
> "Eight hundred forty-seven applications. One role. And you're supposed to find the right person in there."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Slow zoom into screen
- Number counter subtly ticking upward
- Muted colors, slight desaturation

**Why This Works:**
Opens with a specific, quantified problem. Not "hiring is hard" — that's vague. The specificity creates immediate recognition. The stillness creates tension.

---

### Scene 2: The Grind (0:08–0:16)

**What Happens:**
Quick cuts: CV → CV → CV → CV. Each one blurs into the next. Eyes scanning. Scrolling. A rejected candidate's name. Another. Another.

**Voiceover:**
> "You skim. You guess. You hope you didn't miss someone great. And you never really know."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Rapid, rhythmic cuts (1.5 seconds each)
- Text fragments appearing and dissolving
- Subtle shake effect on "you never really know"

**Why This Works:**
Activates muscle memory. Every recruiter has lived this loop. The uncertainty statement ("you never really know") hits a silent fear they don't admit.

---

### Scene 3: The Real Cost (0:16–0:23)

**What Happens:**
Visual shift. Clean white space. A single statistic appears:

> "73% of hiring teams say they've made a bad hire due to time pressure."

Then another:

> "One bad hire costs 6-9 months of salary."

**Voiceover:**
> "Manual screening doesn't just waste time. It costs real money. And it happens over and over."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Minimal, typographic focus
- Numbers animate in with weight
- Slight pulse on "over and over"

**Why This Works:**
Quantifies the pain. Moves from emotional to logical justification. Creates stakes beyond inconvenience.

---

### Scene 4: The Shift (0:23–0:28)

**What Happens:**
Visual tone change. Light entering frame. A breath. Clean interface appears.

**Voiceover:**
> "What if screening wasn't your job anymore?"

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Gradual desaturation reversal
- Soft light bloom
- First glimpse of Niyo interface (partial)

**Why This Works:**
Permission slip. The question invites them to imagine relief without committing. The visual shift signals change is possible.

---

### Scene 5: The System (0:28–0:40)

**What Happens:**
Niyo interface in action. CVs uploading in bulk. Parsing happening instantly. Candidates automatically ranked. A shortlist appearing — clean, clear, ready.

**Voiceover:**
> "Niyo reads every CV in seconds. Scores candidates against your job requirements. And surfaces your shortlist automatically. No screening. No guessing. Just clarity."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Smooth, confident UI animations
- Progress indicators completing instantly
- Candidate cards stacking by rank
- Score badges appearing (92, 87, 84...)

**Why This Works:**
Demonstrates the product without explaining it. The speed is the proof. "No screening. No guessing. Just clarity" is memorable and repeatable.

---

### Scene 6: The Proof (0:40–0:48)

**What Happens:**
Split screen. Left: traditional process (cluttered, slow). Right: Niyo (clean, fast). Time comparison appears:

> "Traditional: 3 weeks. Niyo: 3 hours."

**Voiceover:**
> "Teams using Niyo shortlist in hours, not weeks. And they trust the results because they can see exactly why each candidate ranked where they did."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Side-by-side contrast
- Time indicator racing on right side
- "Explainable scoring" micro-animation

**Why This Works:**
Concrete proof. The "why" differentiates from black-box AI fear. Addresses the skeptic's silent objection.

---

### Scene 7: The Future (0:48–0:55)

**What Happens:**
A hiring manager reviewing three candidates. Confident. Calm. Clicking "Schedule Interview."

**Voiceover:**
> "Imagine starting every role with three qualified candidates. Instead of eight hundred question marks."

**Visuals/Animation:**
- Warm lighting
- Relaxed body language
- Clean candidate comparison view

**Why This Works:**
Contrast with opening scene. Same problem, transformed outcome. The "three" vs "eight hundred" echo reinforces the delta.

---

### Scene 8: The Close (0:55–1:00)

**What Happens:**
Niyo logo. Clean CTA.

**Voiceover:**
> "Stop screening. Start hiring. See your shortlist in seconds."

**On Screen:**
- Logo + tagline
- CTA: "Try Free — No Credit Card"
- Micro-trust: "Your data stays yours"

**Why This Works:**
Clear, action-oriented close. The tagline is the payoff. Low-friction CTA removes final objection.

## Technical Notes for Production

### Pacing
- First 16 seconds: Deliberately slow, heavy
- Seconds 23-48: Faster, lighter, forward momentum
- Final 12 seconds: Confident, measured

### Audio Design
- 0:00–0:23: Minimal music, ambient tension
- 0:23 onward: Building, optimistic underscore
- No sudden drops or swells — sophistication over drama

### Typography
- Sans-serif, modern
- Stats animated with purpose
- No wall of text — one idea per frame

## Why This Strategy Wins

1. **Specificity**: 847 applications, not "lots of CVs"
2. **Truth-telling**: Admits the process is broken, not the user
3. **Show, don't tell**: Interface demo is the proof
4. **Contrast**: Before/after is visceral, not hypothetical
5. **Memorability**: "Stop screening. Start hiring." sticks

This video doesn't sell AI. It sells relief from a problem they've normalized.
