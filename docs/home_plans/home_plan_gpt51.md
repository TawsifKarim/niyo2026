# Homepage Plan GPT-5.1: Outcome Spine, System Story, Honest Edge

## Core Approach
**Tone: Confident, Clear, Candid**

Plan 2 provides the spine: **outcome-led, product-forward, low-friction**.
From Plan 1, we pull **pain escalation and silent objections**.
From Plan 3, we pull **tools vs system, infrastructure, explainability, enterprise trust**.
From Bonus, we pull **selective radical honesty + final humility** — toned down to work as a main homepage.

The result: a homepage that leads with the **shortlist outcome**, grounds it in **hard numbers**, frames Niyo as a **hiring system (not a tool)**, and closes with a **frictionless but honest invitation**.

---

## Section 1: Hero — The Result (Plan 2 Spine)

### Headline
**"Your shortlist. Ready in hours, not weeks."**

### Subheadline
Niyo screens every CV, scores candidates against your requirements, and delivers your top matches — automatically.

### Primary CTA
- **"Start Free — First Shortlist in Minutes"**

### Secondary CTA
- **"See How It Works"** (scrolls to the System section)

### Supporting Visual
- Clean, high-contrast shortlist view showing ~5 candidates ranked with match scores (e.g., 94, 91, 88, 85, 82).
- Badges near the visual:
  - "Average time-to-shortlist: **hours**, not weeks"
  - "Explainable AI — every score shows its work"

### Micro-copy (Honest Edge from Bonus)
Small line under CTAs:
> "If this doesn’t feel clearly better than your current process, you shouldn’t keep using it."

---

## Section 2: Transformation — Before → After (Plan 2, with Plan 1 Pain)

### Section Headline
**"What changes when you stop screening manually"**

### 3-Column Before/After Grid

1. **Time**
   - **Before:** "Weeks of CV review before you interview anyone. 400 applications = 20–40 hours of skimming."
   - **After:** "Top candidates surfaced in hours. Niyo parses and scores every CV for you."

2. **Consistency**
   - **Before:** "Every recruiter screens differently. Monday vs Friday = different results."
   - **After:** "Same criteria. Every candidate. Every time. Consistent scoring across roles and recruiters."

3. **Confidence**
   - **Before:** "Gut decisions you can’t fully explain. You hope you didn’t miss someone better."
   - **After:** "Explainable scores, visible reasons. You know *why* someone ranked where they did."

### Footer Line
"This isn’t a small improvement. It’s a fundamentally different way to hire."

---

## Section 3: The Real Cost (Plan 1 Condensed)

### Section Headline
**"Manual screening doesn’t just take time. It takes opportunity."**

### 3 Pain Blocks

1. **Time Sink**
   - "You spend 6–8 seconds per CV. At 400 applications, that’s 45+ hours before your first interview."
   - Subtext: "Time spent skimming instead of hiring strategically."

2. **Missed Talent**
   - "Rushed screening means great candidates disappear in the pile. Research shows a large share of qualified candidates are rejected due to process overload."
   - Subtext: "Your best hire might already be in your reject folder."

3. **Compounding Risk**
   - "One bad hire can cost 6–9 months of salary. Most companies make several every year without knowing where the process went wrong."
   - Subtext: "The problem compounds quietly — until it’s expensive." 

### Note
Short, sharp copy. Heavy lifting done visually with icons and numbers; this section sets up the value anchor for pricing later.

## Section 4: Proof Point — Speed in the Real World (Plan 2)

### Section Headline
**"400 applications. 12 minutes. Your shortlist."**

### Story Block
"A growing SaaS company posted a single role. 400 applications came in. Niyo parsed every CV, scored each candidate against the job, and delivered a ranked shortlist — in 12 minutes.

Their previous process? Three weeks. Four people. Same outcome — just much slower and more stressful."

### Visual
- Side-by-side mini-comparison bar: **"Before Niyo" vs "With Niyo"** (time and people involved).

---

## Section 5: The System — One Platform, Complete Journey (Plan 2 + Plan 3)

### Section Headline
**"One platform. Complete hiring journey."**

### Subheadline
"Not a point tool. A hiring system that connects every step from job post to confident hire."

### 6-Step Flow (Outcome-Focused)

1. **Post Jobs**
   - "Create clear, compelling job descriptions with AI assistance. Get a branded career page instantly. Share anywhere."

2. **Collect Applications**
   - "Custom forms. Automatic CV parsing. Every data point extracted and organized in one place. No spreadsheets."

3. **Screen & Score (Intelligence Layer)**
   - "Every candidate scored 0–100 against your requirements. Top matches ranked automatically — nothing slips through." 

4. **Manage the Pipeline**
   - "Move candidates through stages. Add notes. Collaborate with your team. See history and status at a glance."

5. **Run Interviews**
   - "Schedule directly or use AI video interviews. Capture structured feedback instead of scattered impressions."

6. **Hire with Confidence**
   - "All the data, all the context, all the history in one place — so your final decision is clear and defensible."

### Key Message (Plan 3)
"These aren’t separate tools. They’re one connected workflow — hiring as a **system**, not a stack of apps."

---

## Section 6: The Intelligence Layer — Structured, Not Conversational (Plan 2 + Plan 3)

### Section Headline
**"AI that reads like you would — but at scale"**

### 3 Pillars

1. **JD-to-CV Matching**
   - "Niyo compares every CV against your job requirements — not just keywords, but context, patterns, and qualifications."

2. **Relevance Scoring with Breakdown**
   - "Each candidate gets a 0–100 relevance score with a clear breakdown: what matched, what didn’t, and why."

3. **Consistent Evaluation**
   - "Same criteria, every candidate, every time. No prompt engineering. No human variation."

### Framing (Plan 3)
"ChatGPT is conversational. Niyo is **structured evaluation**: fixed criteria, explainable scores, repeatable results."

### Footer Line
"You set the standards. AI applies them. You stay in control."

---

## Section 7: Explainability & Trust (Plan 2 + Plan 3)

### Section Headline
**"Explainable AI. Not a black box."**

### Content
"Every score has a reason. For every candidate, you can see:
- Which requirements they matched
- Which skills aligned with the role
- How their experience compared to what you asked for
- Why they ranked above or below others

You can walk your team, your leadership, or your legal department through every decision with a clear trail."

### Supporting Line
"In a world of opaque AI decisions, transparency isn’t just nice to have — it’s a competitive advantage."

---

## Section 8: Positioning — Not an ATS, Not Just an AI Tool (Plan 2 + Plan 3 + Plan 1 Contrast)

### Section Headline
**"Not just an ATS. Not just an AI tool."**

### 3-Row Comparison

**Traditional ATS**
- Great at: Tracking applications, storing records, basic workflows
- Weak at: Deciding who to interview, surfacing top candidates fast
- Missing: Deep screening intelligence, explainable scoring

**Generic AI Tools (incl. ChatGPT)**
- Great at: One-off analysis, rewriting, idea generation
- Weak at: Consistency, audit trails, connected workflows
- Missing: Standard criteria, full pipeline, recruiting context

**Niyo (Hiring System)**
- Combines: Workflow management + AI screening + explainable scoring
- Strong at: Turning applications into ranked shortlists in hours
- Unique: Designed as **hiring infrastructure**, not a bolt-on tool

### Footer Line (Softened from Plan 3 & Bonus)
"The real question isn’t ‘Which tool?’ — it’s ‘What system do we want hiring to run on?’"

---

## Section 9: Results — What Teams Actually Experience (Plan 2 + Plan 3)

### Section Headline
**"When teams switch to Niyo"**

### 3 Outcome Cards

1. **Speed**
   - "Time-to-shortlist dropped from 18 days to 2 hours."
   - Attribution: "Head of Talent, B2B SaaS company"

2. **Scale**
   - "Screened 1,400 candidates across multiple roles without adding recruiters."
   - Attribution: "Founder, fast-growing startup"

3. **Quality & Focus**
   - "Interview-to-offer ratio improved by 30–40%. Fewer wasted interviews, more serious conversations."
   - Attribution: "HR Director, mid-size company"

### Footer Line
"The first shortlist convinces you. The tenth makes it your standard process."

---

## Section 10: Objections — Things You’re Probably Wondering (Plan 1)

### Section Headline
**"Things you might be wondering"**

### Objection Cards

1. **"Is AI screening actually reliable?"**
   - "Niyo’s scoring is explainable — you can see exactly why each candidate ranked where they did. You can override, adjust, and refine criteria as you go."

2. **"What about bias?"**
   - "Consistent criteria reduce random human variation. Explainable scoring makes it easier to spot and correct unfair patterns instead of hiding them."

3. **"We already have an ATS."**
   - "Niyo can work alongside your ATS or replace parts of it. Either way, you add the intelligence your current system doesn’t provide."

4. **"Will this be yet another tool my team ignores?"**
   - "Most teams see value on the first real role they run — because the shortlist and explanations show up fast, in a format they can actually use."

---

## Section 11: Pricing — Value Framed by Real Costs (Plans 1, 2, 3)

### Section Headline
**"Pricing that costs less than one bad hire"**

### Copy
"A bad hire can cost 6–9 months of salary.
Slow hiring costs even more — unfilled roles, delayed projects, missed opportunities.

Niyo is designed to reduce both.
And it costs less than what you’d pay a recruiter for a single week."

### Tier Preview
- **Growth** → For teams hiring occasionally → **$39/mo**
- **Professional** → For teams hiring continuously → **$99/mo**
- **Enterprise** → For teams hiring at scale → **Custom**

### CTAs
- **"See full pricing"** (to pricing page)
- **"Start Free — No Credit Card"**

---

## Section 12: Honest Invitation — Try the System (Plan 2 + Bonus)

### Section Headline
**"See your shortlist appear"**

### Copy
"Upload your first batch of real CVs.
Watch candidates rank by fit.
Read the scoring explanations.

That’s it. That’s what Niyo does.

If it’s not clearly better than what you’re doing now, you stop. No lock-in, no drama."

### CTA
- **"Start Free — See Your Shortlist in Minutes"**

### Trust Badges
- No credit card required
- Cancel anytime
- Data never used for model training without consent
- Full support from day one

---

## Section 13: Final Confession & Brand Line (Softened Bonus + Plan 2/3)

### Subheading
**"One honest thing before you go"**

### Copy
"Niyo won’t make every hire perfect.
No system can.

What it can do is give you more information, more consistency, and more clarity than manual screening, scattered tools, or guesswork.

It’s not magic. It’s hiring infrastructure that finally works the way you wish your process did."

### Brand Line
Centered, simple:

**"Stop screening. Start hiring."**
