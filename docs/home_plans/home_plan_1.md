# Homepage Plan 1: Pain-Escalation-Resolution

## Core Approach
**Tone: Urgent, Empathetic, Direct**

Lead with the pain. Escalate the stakes. Then reveal the exit. This homepage is built for visitors who know something is broken but haven't fully articulated the cost. We make them feel understood, raise their awareness of what they're losing, then offer structured relief.

---

## Scroll Psychology

The page uses **progressive tension release**:
1. Hook with recognition ("that's me")
2. Escalate with hidden costs ("I didn't realize it was this bad")
3. Offer the first relief view ("there's a way out")
4. Prove with demonstration ("this actually works")
5. Address objections ("but what about...")
6. Close with urgency ("I need to start now")

## Section 1: Hero — The Acknowledgment

### Headline
**"You're not bad at hiring. The process is broken."**

### Subheadline
Recruiters lose 23+ hours per role screening unqualified candidates. Most never find the best person — they just find someone good enough before the deadline.

### CTA
"See a better way" (soft scroll CTA) + "Start Free" (action CTA)

### Supporting Element
Simple stat: "Average time to shortlist: 3 weeks. With Niyo: 3 hours."

### Why This Works
Opens with **absolution, not accusation**. The visitor immediately feels understood, not sold to. The stat creates a quantified gap between current state and possible state. Two CTAs serve two mindsets: explorers and ready-buyers.

## Section 2: The Real Cost — What Manual Screening Actually Takes

### Section Headline
**"Manual screening doesn't just take time. It takes everything."**

### Content Structure
Three cost blocks, each with a specific pain point:

1. **Time Cost**
   - "You spend 6-8 seconds per CV. At 400 applications, that's 45+ hours before you've even started interviewing."
   - Implication: You're doing low-value work instead of strategic hiring.

2. **Quality Cost**
   - "Rushed screening means great candidates get missed. Research shows 60% of qualified candidates are rejected due to process overload."
   - Implication: Your best hire might already be in your reject pile.

3. **Hidden Cost**
   - "One bad hire costs 6-9 months of salary. Most companies make 2-3 per year without realizing it."
   - Implication: The problem compounds silently.

### Why This Works
**Escalates stakes without attacking the user.** Each cost builds on the previous. By the end, the visitor understands this isn't just an inconvenience — it's an expensive, repeating problem. This creates psychological readiness for a solution.

## Section 3: The Shift — What If Screening Wasn't Your Job?

### Section Headline
**"What if your next shortlist was already waiting?"**

### Content
Single paragraph, breathing room:
"Imagine opening your dashboard to find your top 10 candidates — already scored, already ranked, already matched to your requirements. No spreadsheets. No guessing. Just a starting point you can trust."

### Supporting Element
First glimpse of Niyo: A simplified representation of the candidate ranking view. Not a feature tour — just a hint of the result.

### Why This Works
**Permission slip.** After escalation, the visitor needs emotional release. This section offers hope without commitment. The question format invites imagination rather than demanding belief. The visual tease creates curiosity about what comes next.

---

## Section 4: How It Actually Works — The System, Not the Features

### Section Headline
**"From job post to shortlist. One system. Zero chaos."**

### Content Structure
End-to-end workflow in 6 connected steps. Each step is outcome-focused, not feature-focused:

1. **Post** — "Create a job and get a branded career page instantly. No designers. No developers."

2. **Collect** — "Applications flow in. Every CV is automatically parsed and organized."

3. **Score** — "AI analyzes each candidate against your requirements. Every match explained."

4. **Rank** — "Your shortlist appears. Top candidates float up. Best matches first."

5. **Interview** — "Schedule live or use AI video interviews. Get structured insights automatically."

6. **Decide** — "All the context. All the history. One confident hire."

### Section Footer
"This isn't six tools. This is one system that replaces all of them."

### Why This Works
**Demonstrates completeness.** Many visitors will assume Niyo is "just a screening tool." This section proves it's an end-to-end system. Outcome-focused language ("your shortlist appears") is more persuasive than feature language ("AI-powered ranking"). The footer reinforces the category: system, not tools.

---

## Section 5: The Proof — Why Shortlists Appear in Hours

### Section Headline
**"Here's why your shortlist appears in hours, not weeks."**

### Content Structure
Three proof pillars:

1. **Bulk Processing**
   - "Niyo ingests and parses 100s of CVs simultaneously. You upload once — we process everything."
   - Proof point: "Average processing time: 37 seconds for 200 CVs."

2. **Explainable Scoring**
   - "Every candidate gets a relevance score based on your job requirements. And you can see exactly why."
   - Proof point: Score breakdown visual — skills matched, experience aligned, requirements met.

3. **Consistent Evaluation**
   - "Same criteria. Every candidate. Every time. No prompt engineering. No human variation."
   - Proof point: "95% screening accuracy reported by users."

### Why This Works
**Addresses the "how does it work?" question.** Skeptical buyers need to understand the mechanism before trusting the outcome. This section provides proof without getting technical. Each pillar answers a specific objection: speed, transparency, reliability.

---

## Section 6: The Contrast — Why This Isn't "Just Another AI Tool"

### Section Headline
**"ChatGPT helps you think. Niyo helps you hire."**

### Content
Honest positioning against the obvious alternative:

"You could paste CVs into ChatGPT. Rewrite prompts every time. Manually track results. Hope your scoring stays consistent.

Or you could use a system that already knows what good hiring looks like.

Niyo isn't a conversation. It's infrastructure."

### Comparison Points (concise)
- **ChatGPT**: One CV at a time, prompt-dependent, no workflow
- **Niyo**: Bulk processing, fixed scoring, complete pipeline

### Section Footer
"We're not anti-AI. We use it. But AI without structure is just another experiment."

### Why This Works
**Neutralizes the silent objection.** Every SaaS visitor in 2026 is thinking "can't I just use ChatGPT?" This section respects that intelligence while showing why tool ≠ system. The framing is strategic, not defensive.

## Section 7: Social Proof — Results, Not Reviews

### Section Headline
**"What happens after teams switch to Niyo"**

### Content Structure
Three quantified outcomes from real users (or representative case studies):

1. **Speed**
   - "Reduced time-to-shortlist from 3 weeks to 2 days."
   - Attribution: "[Title], [Company Type]"

2. **Quality**
   - "Interview-to-offer ratio improved by 40% in the first quarter."
   - Attribution: "[Title], [Company Type]"

3. **Scale**
   - "Screened 1,200 candidates across 8 roles without adding headcount."
   - Attribution: "[Title], [Company Type]"

### Why This Works
**Outcome-focused proof.** Generic testimonials ("Great tool!") don't convert. Specific, quantified results do. The three proof points address the three things buyers care about: speed, quality, scale. Attribution by role/company type helps visitors see themselves.

## Section 8: Objection Block — Silent Doubts, Spoken Answers

### Section Headline
**"Things you might be wondering"**

### Content Structure
Not an FAQ. A preemptive objection-handler:

1. **"Is AI screening actually reliable?"**
   - "Niyo's scoring is explainable — you can see exactly why each candidate ranked where they did. It's not a black box."

2. **"What about bias?"**
   - "Consistent criteria = reduced human variation. Every candidate is evaluated the same way, every time."

3. **"We already have an ATS."**
   - "Niyo works alongside your ATS or replaces it entirely. Either way, you get intelligence your current system doesn't provide."

4. **"What if we need something custom?"**
   - "Enterprise plans include custom evaluation frameworks, integrations, and dedicated support. Talk to us."

### Why This Works
**Removes exit friction.** By this point, the visitor is interested but may have lingering doubts. Addressing them directly — in their language — prevents silent drop-off. The ATS question is particularly important for mid-market buyers.

## Section 9: Pricing Preview — The Cost Anchor

### Section Headline
**"Pricing that costs less than one bad hire"**

### Content
Brief pricing philosophy + anchor:

"A bad hire costs 6-9 months of salary. Niyo costs less than that per year.

Every plan includes AI screening, candidate scoring, and pipeline management. Start free. Upgrade when your hiring grows."

### Pricing Tiers (summary only)
- **Growth** — For teams hiring occasionally → $39/mo
- **Professional** — For teams hiring continuously → $99/mo
- **Enterprise** — For teams hiring at scale → Custom

### CTA
"See full pricing" + "Start free"

### Why This Works
**Reframes price as insurance.** The anchor (bad hire cost) makes plan prices feel trivial by comparison. Brief tier descriptions guide self-selection without overwhelming. This section creates value perception before the full pricing page.

---

## Section 10: Final CTA — Urgency Without Pressure

### Section Headline
**"Your next shortlist is waiting"**

### Content
Single, direct invitation:

"Upload real CVs. See real rankings. No demo data. No sales call required.

In 5 minutes, you'll know if Niyo works for you."

### CTA
"Start Free — No Credit Card"

### Trust Badges
- Cancel anytime
- Your data stays yours
- Explainable AI — not a black box

### Why This Works
**Creates forward motion without pressure.** The time estimate ("5 minutes") makes action feel low-risk. The trust badges remove the last remaining objections. The promise is experience, not commitment.
