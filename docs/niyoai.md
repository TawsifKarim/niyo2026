# Niyo AI — Concise Product Overview

## What Niyo AI Is

Niyo AI is an end‑to‑end hiring system that uses AI to automate the journey from job posting to final hire. Instead of just being an ATS or a standalone AI tool, it combines workflow orchestration, candidate data processing, and explainable scoring so teams can hire faster with more consistent decisions.

## Who It’s For

- Founders and small teams hiring a few roles a year who want to stop manual CV screening.
- Growing companies hiring continuously that need speed and consistency without adding more recruiters.
- Larger organizations that treat hiring as a repeatable, auditable system and care about risk, bias control, and analytics.

## Problems Niyo AI Solves

- Manual CV screening that wastes hundreds of recruiter hours on unqualified candidates.
- Fragmented hiring workflows spread across job boards, spreadsheets, email, and generic AI tools.
- Inconsistent, hard‑to‑explain hiring decisions that depend on individual recruiters’ judgment and prompts.
- Lack of visibility into why candidates move forward or are rejected.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Job Posting & Career Site

- Create job posts in seconds with AI‑assisted job description generation.
- Auto‑generated, branded career pages with a custom subdomain (e.g., company.niyo.careers).
- Shareable application links that can be used on LinkedIn, your website, or job boards.
- Mobile‑responsive career site that is ready without designers or developers.

### 2. Smart Application Collection

- Custom application forms with screening questions tailored to each role.
- Every CV is parsed and normalized into a structured candidate profile.
- All application data is automatically extracted, organized, and ready for scoring.

### 3. AI Screening, Scoring, and Ranking

- JD‑to‑CV matching that compares job requirements against candidate qualifications.
- Relevance scoring (0–100) using multiple factors, with auto‑ranking so the best matches float to the top.
- Custom criteria and scoring weights so teams can reflect role‑specific priorities.
- Shortlists generated in minutes instead of days, with reported screening accuracy in the mid‑90% range.

### 4. Candidate Pipeline & Workflow

- Structured stages from application to offer, managed in a unified pipeline.
- Ability to move candidates between stages without losing history or context.
- Designed for teams: comments, notes, and shared views so everyone sees the same picture.

### 5. Interviews and Evaluation

- Scheduling support plus AI video interviews so candidates can record responses asynchronously.
- AI‑driven analysis of video responses to highlight key competencies and patterns.
- Consistent, structured evaluation instead of ad‑hoc notes and subjective impressions.

### 6. Analytics, Reporting, and Explainability

- Hiring analytics that show funnel performance and where time is being spent.
- Reporting that clarifies why candidates are recommended or rejected (explainable scoring).
- Support for audit trails, collaboration history, and decision records for teams that care about compliance and fairness.

## How Niyo AI Compares

### Versus ChatGPT and General AI Tools

- Handles bulk CV ingestion and automatic collection, instead of manual copy‑paste workflows.
- Uses fixed, explainable scoring frameworks rather than prompt‑dependent answers.
- Provides built‑in bias controls, structured evaluation, and audit trails.
- Offers an end‑to‑end hiring pipeline (job → shortlist → interview) instead of one‑off AI helpers.
- Delivers hiring‑specific UX designed for recruiters, not generic chat interfaces.

**Key idea:** ChatGPT helps you think; Niyo helps you hire. General AI tools are great for ad‑hoc analysis, but they don’t give you a repeatable, collaborative hiring system.

### Versus Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)

- Goes beyond keyword filters by using pattern‑based, contextual matching.
- Adds standardized, explainable scoring and predictive signals to support better decisions.
- Integrates interviews, evaluations, and AI video analysis inside the same workflow.
- Builds bias‑aware screening, transparency, and fairness into the process.
- Focuses on decision quality and speed, not just record‑keeping and compliance.

### Versus Narrow, AI‑Only Point Tools

- Replaces isolated, single‑function AI utilities (e.g., only parsing or only question generation) with a connected system.
- Avoids fragmented workflows that require stitching multiple tools together.
- Treats intelligence and process orchestration as one product: a hiring system, not a feature bundle.

## Pricing and Plans (Positioning)

Niyo’s pricing is designed to cost less than a bad hire while removing the hidden cost of manual screening.

- Entry plan for occasional hiring: focuses on replacing chaotic manual CV review with basic AI screening and shortlisting.
- Growth plan for continuous hiring: emphasizes unlimited or high‑volume screening, structured scoring, AI video interviews, and team collaboration.
- Scale / Enterprise plan: treats hiring as a system, with custom evaluation frameworks, analytics, bias control, advanced permissions, and support commitments (e.g., SLAs, dedicated help).

Across plans, the narrative centers on:

- Time saved per role (often dozens of hours of screening).
- Reduced risk of inconsistent or biased decisions.
- The ability to run a repeatable, measurable hiring process instead of starting from scratch every time.

## Strategic Positioning Summary

- **Primary outcome:** Faster, more consistent hiring decisions with far less manual screening.
- **Why teams buy it:** To turn AI from a set of experiments into a dependable, auditable hiring engine.
- **Core message:** Stop screening. Start hiring — with a system that makes your next shortlist appear in minutes, not weeks.
