# Homepage Plan 2: Outcome-Led Aspiration

## Core Approach
**Tone: Confident, Clean, Aspirational**

Lead with the destination. Show the result first. Let the visitor crave the outcome before they understand the mechanism. This homepage is built for buyers who are solution-aware — they know they need better hiring, they just need to see what "better" looks like.

---

## Scroll Psychology

The page uses **desire-then-explanation**:
1. Hook with outcome ("I want that")
2. Quantify the transformation ("that's impressive")
3. Explain the how ("now I understand")
4. Prove with evidence ("others got this")
5. Build to action ("let me experience it")

---

## Section 1: Hero — The Result

### Headline
**"Your shortlist. Ready in hours, not weeks."**

### Subheadline
Niyo screens every CV, scores candidates against your requirements, and delivers your top matches — automatically.

### CTA
"Start Free — First Shortlist in Minutes" (primary)
"See How It Works" (secondary scroll)

### Supporting Element
Visual: A clean shortlist showing 5 candidates ranked with match scores (94, 91, 87, 85, 82). Not a wireframe — but a representation of the output.

### Why This Works
**Leads with the payoff.** The visitor immediately sees what success looks like. No abstraction, no feature talk — just the result. The hero answers the question every buyer has: "What do I actually get?" The dual CTAs serve action-takers and explorers.

---

## Section 2: The Transformation — Before → After

### Section Headline
**"What changes when you stop screening manually"**

### Content Structure
Clear before/after contrast in three dimensions:

1. **Time**
   - Before: "Weeks of CV review before you interview anyone"
   - After: "Top candidates surfaced in hours"

2. **Consistency**
   - Before: "Every recruiter screens differently"  
   - After: "Same criteria. Every candidate. Every time."

3. **Confidence**
   - Before: "Gut decisions you can't explain"
   - After: "Explainable scores you can stand behind"

### Section Footer
"This isn't a small improvement. It's a fundamentally different way to hire."

### Why This Works
**Makes the transformation tangible.** Abstract promises ("save time") don't stick. Specific contrasts do. Each dimension addresses a real pain (speed, consistency, accountability) and shows the exact shift. The footer elevates the change from incremental to categorical.

---

## Section 3: The Proof Point — Speed That's Real

### Section Headline
**"400 applications. 12 minutes. Your shortlist."**

### Content
Single powerful proof statement with context:

"Last month, a growing SaaS company posted a single role. 400 applications poured in. Niyo processed every CV, scored each candidate, and delivered a ranked shortlist — in 12 minutes.

Their previous process? Three weeks. Four people. Same outcome."

### Why This Works
**Specific, vivid, memorable.** The numbers are precise because precision creates belief. The comparison to "three weeks, four people" makes the improvement concrete. This section is designed to be screenshot-able — the kind of stat that gets shared.

---

## Section 4: The System — How Niyo Actually Works

### Section Headline
**"One platform. Complete hiring journey."**

### Content Structure
End-to-end flow, emphasis on connection:

1. **Post Jobs**
   - "Create job descriptions with AI assistance. Get a branded career page instantly. Share links anywhere."

2. **Collect Applications**
   - "Custom application forms. Automatic CV parsing. Every piece of data extracted and organized."

3. **AI Screening & Scoring**
   - "Every candidate scored against your requirements. Top matches ranked automatically. Nothing slips through."

4. **Pipeline Management**
   - "Move candidates through stages. Add notes. Collaborate with your team. Everything in one view."

5. **Interviews**
   - "Schedule directly or use AI video interviews. Get structured insights. No more scattered notes."

6. **Hire with Confidence**
   - "All the data. All the context. One clear decision."

### Key Message
"These aren't separate tools. They're one connected workflow."

### Why This Works
**Demonstrates completeness while staying outcome-focused.** Each step emphasizes what the user gets, not what the product does. The connecting message ("one workflow") positions Niyo as a system — critical for differentiation.

---

## Section 5: The Intelligence Layer — Why AI Screening Works

### Section Headline
**"AI that reads like you would — but faster"**

### Content
Three intelligence pillars:

1. **JD-to-CV Matching**
   - "Niyo compares every CV against your job requirements. Not just keywords — context, patterns, qualifications."

2. **Relevance Scoring**
   - "0-100 score based on actual fit. With breakdown: what matched, what didn't, and why."

3. **Consistent Evaluation**
   - "No human variation. No prompt engineering. The same fair process for every candidate."

### Section Footer
"You set the criteria. AI applies it at scale. You make the final call."

### Why This Works
**Builds trust in the AI layer.** Skeptics need to understand the mechanism. This section explains without getting technical. The footer is critical: it positions AI as a tool the user controls, not a replacement.

---

## Section 6: Trust Section — Why Teams Trust Their Shortlists

### Section Headline
**"Explainable scoring. Not a black box."**

### Content
Direct address of the transparency concern:

"Every score has a reason. For every candidate, you can see:
- Which requirements they matched
- Which skills aligned with the role
- Why they ranked where they did

No mystery. No 'trust us.' Just clarity."

### Supporting Statement
"This is what separates a hiring system from an AI experiment."

### Why This Works
**Attacks the #1 AI objection head-on.** Visitors are trained to distrust AI decisions. Niyo's explainability is a genuine differentiator — this section makes it a selling point, not just a feature.

---

## Section 7: Results Section — What Teams Experience

### Section Headline
**"When teams switch to Niyo"**

### Content Structure
Outcome-focused proof points:

1. **"Time-to-shortlist dropped from 18 days to 2 hours"**
   - "[Head of Talent, B2B SaaS company]"

2. **"We screened 1,400 candidates without adding recruiters"**
   - "[Founder, Growing startup]"

3. **"Interview acceptance rate improved by 35%"**
   - "[HR Director, Mid-size company]"

### Section Footer
"The first shortlist convinces you. The tenth makes it your process."

### Why This Works
**Quantified results build belief.** Generic testimonials fail. Specific outcomes succeed. Three different metrics (speed, scale, quality) address three different buyer priorities. The footer plants the seed of long-term adoption.

---

## Section 8: Positioning Section — How Niyo Is Different

### Section Headline
**"Not just an ATS. Not just an AI tool."**

### Content
Clear category positioning:

"Applicant tracking systems are great at organizing. But they don't tell you who to interview.

AI tools are great at analyzing. But they're fragments — one task, one prompt, one result.

Niyo is different: a complete hiring system that combines workflow + intelligence. Post. Collect. Score. Rank. Interview. Hire. All connected."

### Key Differentiator
"This is what hiring looks like when it's designed as a system, not assembled from parts."

### Why This Works
**Creates category clarity.** Visitors arrive with mental models: "Is this an ATS?" or "Is this like ChatGPT?" This section rejects both frames and establishes Niyo's unique position. The "designed vs assembled" line is memorable positioning.

---

## Section 9: Pricing Philosophy — Value Before Numbers

### Section Headline
**"Fair pricing. Real value."**

### Content
Brief philosophy statement:

"Good pricing is simple: it should cost less than the problem it solves.

One bad hire costs 6-9 months of salary.
Niyo costs less than that per year.

Every plan includes AI screening, candidate scoring, and pipeline management."

### Tier Preview
- **Growth** → For occasional hiring → $39/mo
- **Professional** → For continuous hiring → $99/mo  
- **Enterprise** → For scaled hiring → Custom

### CTA
"See full pricing" + "Start free"

### Why This Works
**Anchors value before price.** The cost comparison (bad hire vs. subscription) reframes the decision from expense to investment. Tier preview guides self-selection without friction.

---

## Section 10: Transition to Action — The Invitation

### Section Headline
**"See your shortlist appear"**

### Content
Simple, confident close:

"Upload your first batch of CVs.
Watch candidates rank by fit.
Know who to interview — in minutes.

That's it. That's what Niyo does."

### CTA
"Start Free — No Credit Card Required"

### Trust Badges
- 14-day money-back guarantee
- Data never used for model training
- Cancel anytime

### Why This Works
**Creates momentum to action.** The three-step description makes the trial feel simple. "That's it" cuts through complexity. Trust badges remove final friction points.

---

## Section 11: Final Thought — The Sticky Message

### Content
One-liner to leave in the visitor's mind:

**"Stop screening. Start hiring."**

### Why This Works
**Memorable brand positioning.** This line encapsulates the entire value proposition in four words. It becomes the phrase they remember, repeat, and associate with Niyo.
