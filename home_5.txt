## 1. Motion Hero Section

## 2. The Real Cost (Problem Section)
- **Main Heading:** Manual screening doesn't just take time. It takes everything.
- **Point 1: Time Cost**
    - Description: You spend 6-8 seconds per CV. At 400 applications, that's 45+ hours before you've even started interviewing.
    - Implication: Using high-value time on low-value work.
- **Point 2: Quality Cost**
    - Description: Rushed screening means great candidates get missed. 60% of qualified candidates are rejected due to fatigue.
    - Implication: Your best hire is in the reject pile.
- **Point 3: Hidden Cost**
    - Description: One bad hire costs 6-9 months of salary. Most companies make 2-3 per year without realizing it.
    - Implication: The problem compounds silently.

## 3. How It Works
- **Main Heading:** From job post to shortlist. One system. Zero chaos.
- **Step 01: Post**
    - Description: Create a job and get a branded career page instantly. No designers. No developers.
- **Step 02: Collect & Score**
    - Description: Applications flow in. AI analyzes each candidate against your requirements instantly.
- **Step 03: Rank & Hire**
    - Description: Your shortlist appears. Top candidates float up. Schedule interviews with one click.
- **Conclusion:** This isn't six tools. This is one system that replaces all of them.

## 4. The Proof (Speed & Evaluation)

## 5. Contrast: Niyo vs ChatGPT
- **Question:** "Why not just use ChatGPT?"
- **Answer:** ChatGPT is great at answers. We also use ChatGPT internally. But real hiring requires systems, structure, and accountability.
- **Perspective:** "ChatGPT helps you think. Niyo helps you hire"
- **Comparison Table:**
    | Capability | ChatGPT | Niyo |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | Bulk CV ingestion | Manual copy-paste | Auto-upload |
    | Consistent scoring | Inconsistent | Fixed criteria |
    | Bias control | None | Fairness built-in |
    | End-to-end workflow | None | Unified pipeline |
    | Team collaboration | Not possible | Full access |
    | Audit trail | Chat only | Full records |
    | Hiring-specific UX | General | Recruiter-first |
