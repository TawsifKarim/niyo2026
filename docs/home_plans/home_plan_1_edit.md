# Goal 
To improve home_plan_1.html file. 

Replace `Recruiters lose 23+ hours per role screening. Most never find the best person—they just find someone "good enough" before the deadline.` with `Your shortlist.
Ready in minutes, not weeks.`

Keep the section `Manual screening doesn't just take time.
It takes everything.`

Remove `What if your next shortlist
was already waiting?` section.
