# Homepage Plan 3: Category-Defining Authority

## Core Approach
**Tone: Thought-Leader, Editorial, Sophisticated**

Lead with an insight that reframes the problem. Establish Niyo as the company that understands hiring better than buyers do themselves. This homepage is built for sophisticated decision-makers who've tried multiple solutions and are tired of incremental improvements. They want a smarter take, not another feature list.

---

## Scroll Psychology

The page uses **insight-led persuasion**:
1. Hook with reframe ("I never thought about it that way")
2. Validate their experience ("that's exactly what happened")
3. Present a new category ("this is what I've been missing")
4. Prove capability ("they can actually deliver this")
5. Close with invitation ("let me see if it's real")

---

## Section 1: Hero — The Reframe

### Headline
**"Everyone added AI to their hiring. Almost no one got better at hiring."**

### Subheadline
Hiring isn't a tool problem. It's a system problem. Niyo is the system that actually makes AI work for recruiting.

### CTA
"See the difference" (scroll CTA) + "Start Free" (action CTA)

### Supporting Element
No stats. Just a single thought: "In 2026, AI is cheap. Tools are everywhere. Consistent hiring decisions are still rare."

### Why This Works
**Opens with intellectual provocation.** The headline is counterintuitive — it challenges the assumption that "AI = better." Sophisticated buyers will recognize this truth from their own experience. The hero positions Niyo as the company that understands the real problem.

---

## Section 2: The Diagnosis — Why Tools Haven't Fixed Hiring

### Section Headline
**"More AI hasn't meant better hiring. Here's why."**

### Content Structure
Three failure modes, each with a brief diagnosis:

1. **The Fragmentation Problem**
   - "Teams added AI screening. Then AI scheduling. Then AI chatbots. Now they manage more tools than before — and hiring still feels manual."

2. **The Consistency Problem**
   - "ChatGPT is brilliant until you realize every prompt produces different results. There's no standard. No repeatability. No audit trail."

3. **The Integration Problem**
   - "Point solutions create data silos. Your screening tool doesn't talk to your ATS. Your ATS doesn't capture why candidates were rejected. Decision history disappears."

### Section Footer
"Tools improve individual tasks. They don't improve the system."

### Why This Works
**Validates frustration without blame.** Sophisticated buyers have tried AI tools and been disappointed. This section names their experience and gives it structure. The diagnosis creates an opening for the solution: what they need isn't more tools — it's a system.

---

## Section 3: The Category — What a Hiring System Actually Is

### Section Headline
**"The difference between tools and systems"**

### Content
Clear category distinction:

"A **tool** helps you complete a task. Parse a CV. Score a candidate. Send an email.

A **system** connects tasks into a workflow. Enforces consistency. Creates history. Produces repeatable outcomes.

Most hiring stacks are collections of tools pretending to be systems. Niyo is a system from the ground up."

### Key Insight
"You don't need smarter tools. You need a smarter process."

### Why This Works
**Establishes a new category.** This section changes the buying criteria. Visitors arrive asking "which tool is best?" This section teaches them to ask "do I have a system?" Niyo becomes the answer to the better question.

---

## Section 4: The System in Practice — How Niyo Works Differently

### Section Headline
**"What hiring looks like as a system"**

### Content Structure
The complete workflow, presented as an integrated whole:

**Job → Application → Intelligence → Pipeline → Interview → Decision**

Each stage connects to the next:

1. **Job Posting**
   - "Create jobs with AI-assisted descriptions. Get a branded career page instantly. Applications start flowing — all funneled into one place."

2. **Application Collection**
   - "Every CV is parsed. Every data point extracted. Nothing is lost. Nothing requires manual entry."

3. **AI Intelligence Layer**
   - "Every candidate is scored against your requirements. Same criteria, every candidate, every time. Scores are explainable — you can see exactly why."

4. **Pipeline Management**
   - "Move candidates through stages. Collaborate with notes. Status and history preserved. Everyone sees the same picture."

5. **Interviews**
   - "Schedule directly or use AI video interviews. Get structured evaluation. No more scattered impressions."

6. **Decision Support**
   - "All the context. All the scoring. All the history. Make confident decisions with full visibility."

### The Connecting Message
"This is what happens when hiring is designed as infrastructure, not bolted together from apps."

### Why This Works
**Shows the system, not just the features.** The connection between stages is the point. Each element flows into the next. The final message reinforces category positioning: infrastructure, not tools.

---

## Section 5: The Intelligence Difference — Why Niyo's AI Actually Works

### Section Headline
**"AI that's structured, not conversational"**

### Content
Contrast between prompt-based AI and systematic AI:

"ChatGPT requires you to engineer prompts. Write instructions every time. Hope for consistent output.

Niyo's AI is different: it's structured evaluation, not conversation. Fixed criteria. Explainable scores. The same process at scale.

You set the standards. AI applies them. You verify the results."

### Key Differentiator
"AI without structure is an experiment. AI with structure is infrastructure."

### Why This Works
**Addresses the ChatGPT objection at the category level.** Rather than competing on features, Niyo competes on architecture. The distinction (conversation vs. structure) is sophisticated and memorable. This is the kind of positioning that resonates with buyers who've been burned by AI hype.

---

## Section 6: The Explainability Section — Decisions You Can Stand Behind

### Section Headline
**"Explainable AI. Not trust-us AI."**

### Content
Deep transparency positioning:

"Every candidate receives a score. Every score has components:
- Requirements matched
- Skills aligned
- Experience evaluated
- Fit calculated

You see the reasoning. You can verify it. You can explain it to your team, your leadership, your legal department.

This isn't AI that asks for blind trust. It's AI that shows its work."

### Section Footer
"In a world of black boxes, transparency is a competitive advantage."

### Why This Works
**Elevates explainability from feature to philosophy.** In 2026, AI skepticism is real. This section turns Niyo's transparency into a principled stance, not just a checkbox. The "legal department" reference signals enterprise-readiness.

---

## Section 7: The Results — Evidence, Not Testimonials

### Section Headline
**"What teams report after switching"**

### Content Structure
Three data-backed outcomes:

1. **Process Compression**
   - "Teams report reducing time-to-shortlist by 80-90%. What took weeks now happens in hours."
   - Supporting stat: "Average screening time per role: 2.3 hours vs. industry average of 23+ hours."

2. **Decision Quality**
   - "Interview-to-offer ratios improve when screening is consistent. Teams using Niyo report 30-40% fewer wasted interviews."
   - Supporting stat: "Candidates advancing to offer stage match rate: 78%."

3. **Scale Without Headcount**
   - "Hiring teams handle 3-5x more applications without adding recruiters."
   - Supporting stat: "Average applications processed per recruiter: 1,200/month vs. industry 350/month."

### Why This Works
**Evidence-based credibility.** Sophisticated buyers want data, not hype. Each outcome addresses a real business concern: speed, quality, efficiency. Stats are specific enough to be believable.

## Section 8: The Positioning Table — Where Niyo Fits

### Section Headline
**"Niyo vs. the alternatives"**

### Content
Clear positioning against both ATS and AI-only tools:

**Traditional ATS**
- Great for: Tracking applications, compliance, record-keeping
- Weak at: Decision support, candidate intelligence, speed
- Missing: AI-powered screening, explainable ranking

**AI-Only Tools**
- Great for: Single tasks (parsing, scoring, chatting)
- Weak at: Connected workflows, consistency, collaboration
- Missing: End-to-end system, pipeline management

**Niyo**
- Combines: Workflow management + AI intelligence
- Unique: Explainable scoring, consistent criteria, complete pipeline
- Result: Hiring as a repeatable, auditable system

### Section Footer
"The question isn't 'which tool?' It's 'what system?'"

### Why This Works
**Clarifies competitive positioning.** Buyers arrive with mental models. This section acknowledges what alternatives do well, then shows what's missing. The fair treatment of competitors builds credibility. The framing ("what system?") reinforces category positioning.

---

## Section 9: The Trust Layer — Addressing Serious Concerns

### Section Headline
**"Built for teams who take hiring seriously"**

### Content Structure
Enterprise-grade trust signals:

1. **Data Privacy**
   - "Your data is never used to train models. Candidate information stays yours."

2. **Bias Awareness**
   - "Consistent criteria reduces human variation. Explainable scoring supports fair review."

3. **Compliance Ready**
   - "Decision history preserved. Audit trails built-in. Ready for legal, HR, and leadership review."

4. **Control**
   - "You set the criteria. AI applies them. You make the final call. Always."

### Why This Works
**Addresses enterprise objections.** Sophisticated buyers (and their legal teams) have specific concerns about AI in hiring. This section shows Niyo has thought through these issues. The "Always" at the end is critical: human control is non-negotiable.

---

## Section 10: Pricing Philosophy — Investment, Not Expense

### Section Headline
**"What hiring intelligence actually costs"**

### Content
Framed as investment logic:

"Every company knows the cost of a bad hire: 6-9 months of salary, plus team disruption, plus rehiring time.

Most companies don't measure the cost of slow hiring: roles unfilled, projects delayed, opportunity missed.

Niyo addresses both. For less than you'd pay a recruiter for a week."

### Tier Preview
- **Growth** → Teams hiring occasionally → $39/mo
- **Professional** → Teams hiring continuously → $99/mo
- **Enterprise** → Teams hiring at scale → Custom

### CTA
"See full pricing" + "Start free today"

### Why This Works
**Reframes pricing as risk reduction.** The bad-hire cost is the anchor. The slow-hiring cost adds a second dimension most buyers don't calculate. The recruiter comparison ("less than a week") makes the price feel trivial.

---

## Section 11: Final Section — The Confident Close

### Section Headline
**"The first shortlist makes the case"**

### Content
Simple, direct invitation:

"Don't take our word for it.

Upload real CVs. Run a real job through the system. See how fast candidates rank. Read the scoring explanations.

If this isn't clearly better than what you're doing now, we failed.

But teams keep coming back. That's the proof."

### CTA
"Start Free — No Credit Card Required"

### Trust Elements
- Cancel anytime
- No data sharing
- Full support from day one

### Why This Works
**Confident without arrogance.** The framing ("if we're not clearly better, we failed") shows confidence in the product. The "teams keep coming back" line plants the retention message. The CTA is low-friction.

---

## Section 12: Closing Thought — The Brand Line

### Content
One memorable positioning statement:

**"Stop adding tools. Start building a hiring system."**

### Why This Works
**Memorable, actionable, true.** This line encapsulates the entire strategic position. It's the anti-fragmentation message that sophisticated buyers have been waiting to hear.
